Hello! Currently this project is very bare bones but I plan to regularly update it and remake my to do list that was originally in JQuery. For my most recent update I created a server and connect it to the database.

### Technologies

Javascript,
CSS,
HTML,
Boostrap,
React,
Express,
Node.js

### Issues

This is the second version of my updated to do list. I believe I made an error during the original dependency installations and I did not realize this error until I was well into my project. I remade the project in order to test my installations. The test project worked so I decided to force push my test project into the repository since it was too late to create a separate branch.
