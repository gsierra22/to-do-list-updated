## To Do List

In this simple App I user can view a list of tasks they need to complete, add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete them afterwards. I remade this app in react from it's original version using JQuery. The original can be viewed at the following link: https://github.com/gsierra22/weekend-sql-to-do-list. This is still a work in Progress. Next I am hoping on finishing up the app's syling with Bootstrap and adding redux and saga into it.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Create database and table

Create a new database called `to-do-list` and utilize the database.sql page to create the table

## Development Setup Instructions

- Run `npm install`
- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm run server`
- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`

### Issues

This is the second version of my updated to do list. I believe I made an error during the original dependency installations and I did not realize this error until I was well into my project. I remade the project in order to test my installations. The test project worked so I decided to force push my test project into the repository since it was too late to create a separate branch.
